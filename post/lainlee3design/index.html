                    <p>Recently I was looking for a designer to collaborate with on a project
called <a href="/post/codearmory">Code Armory</a>. I started looking for online resources to meet some
talented designers. I discovered a site called
<a href="http://collabfinder.com">CollabFinder</a> and immediately realized I had
discovered something of extraordinary value.</p>

<p>CollabFinder allows you to search for designers, developers, artists,
writers, and scientists by physical location, skills, and interests. You
can pitch them a project you&#39;d like to &quot;collaborate&quot; on (collaboration
in this context, means non-monetary help). </p>

<p>So I started looking for designers in the San Francisco area, found some
really talented people, sent them a note about the project I needed help
on, and within an hour I had my replies. I quickly started emailing back
and forth with a designer named <a href="http://twitter.com/lainlee3design">Lain Lee</a>.
He told me he needed some help coding his new design site, and asked if
I&#39;d be interested in trading services. We actually met at Starbucks down
the road from my office that same day, and started talking about our ideas
and life in general. We just clicked. Our interests and passions line up so well.
It&#39;s been a great partnership. Today, I&#39;m happy to say we launched
Lain&#39;s <a href="http://lainlee3design.com">new site</a>.
The site was put together with KirbyCMS, a few jQuery plugins, and
some good ol&#39; fashioned elbow grease.</p>

<p>Quick word about Lain as a designer/illustrator: this guy is one heck of
an artist. Since we&#39;ve started working together I&#39;ve started to follow
his work, and honestly, every thing the guy
creates is pure gold. Check out this
<a href="http://lainlee3design.com/avengers-assemble-timelapse">timelapse</a> of his mad 
illustration skills! The stuff he&#39;s designed for Code Armory is
absolutely perfect. Excellent illustration, web design, and it totally
lines up with my vision for this new project. I&#39;ll be sure to write more
as I move further along with it.</p>

<p>Make sure you head over and check out his new site
(<a href="http://lainlee3design.com">http://lainlee3design.com</a>). Check out his
portfolio and see what you think. I&#39;d highly recommend him for any of your
design needs.</p>
