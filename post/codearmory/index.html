    <div class="post-body">
      <p>I've been using Gists a lot recently to pass code back and forth between
myself and my co-workers, and I'm starting to realize more and more how
valuable good code snippets can be. I find myself perusing Github all
the time to see what other people are working on and half the time I
stumble upon some small, reusable piece of code that I force myself to
grab and dump into my own little directory of code snippets.</p>

<p>The more and more I collect, the more I realize the process of finding
good code snippets on the web is pretty terrible. I often just hit
google and wind up on stack overflow, having to sift through a bunch of
people's ramblings and log files and whatnot. Why isn't there a better
place to search for these small bits of wonder-code?</p>

<p>I set out to see if it already existed, and it turns out that it
doesn't. So I plan on creating one.</p>

<h4>Side Story</h4>

<p>My sister-in-law went into labor last week so my wife and I
went down to Lemoore Naval Air Station to see the baby. As I was driving
off the base I saw a sign indicating which way to turn to get to the
Armory. That's when it hit me. This code snippet site need not only
focus on code snippets. I want to make it a place where developers get
equipped in every way they need.</p>

<h4>The Plan</h4>

<p>Offer the soldiers (developers) a chance to stock up on weapons
(snippets), load up on ammo (frameworks/libraries), engage in training
(walkthroughs) and choose their
barracks (development environments). The latter will most likely allow
for users to peruse various <a href="http://vagrantup.com">vagrant</a> boxes and
associated chef recipes (if you don't know about vagrant, get it).</p>

<h4>Implementation</h4>

<p>Like I said I love Gists. Rather than re-inventing the wheel
this new project is simply going to
leverage gists. I'll add some meta-data to various gists to create a place
where code snippets can be searched and saved more easily.</p>

<p>Why hasn't Github added this to Gist already? My bet is they've been
busy. You know, redefining how everyone codes? They might
get around to improving Gist, but for now, I'm taking it upon myself.
Who's with me?</p>

<h4>I Need Help</h4>

<p>I don't know about you, but this sounds like a dream to me. But I'm
going to need help in getting some solid content onto this site. If you
can help spread the word, or send me some code snippets you've found to
be invaluable, it would go a long way toward getting this project off
the ground.</p>
