    <h1>Gitwar: Gaming with Git</h1>
    
    <h4>May 10 2013</h4>
    

    <div class="post-body">
      <p>I recently came across a <a href="https://github.com/blog/1499-the-revolution-will-be-forked">blog
post</a> that talked about non-developers using Git and GitHub to
do some pretty cool things. It got me thinking about other cool and unusual
things possible with GitHub.</p>

<p>Then I started thinking about games and wondered what it would look like
to have a game with Git at the center. Not something as lame as "who can
create the most branches with the most inappropriate names in the
shortest amount of time?" More like a family of two-player,
head-to-head, text-based, turn-based games with Git as the transfer
protocol.</p>

<p>So I made one, and I did it all in <strong>BASH</strong>.</p>

<p>The games are built using a "platform" called
<a href="http://github.com/gitwar/gitwar">Gitwar</a>. It's a shared
utility that takes care of adding, committing, pushing, and pulling
to/from the shared repo.</p>

<p>The first game is called
<a href="http://github.com/gitwar/gitwar/tree/master/gitfight">Gitfight</a> and it's an incredibly simple/corny game where
you tell the game what kind of punch you'd like to throw at your
opponent and basically roll a virtual die to see how much damage you
deal. After you submit your punch, Gitwar takes over and commits that
action to your repo and your opponent can have a chance to punch back.</p>

<p>The second game was an obvious choice. It's called
<a href="http://github.com/gitwar/gitwar/tree/master/gitchess">Gitchess</a>. This is
where I had the most fun. Creating a more complex game in BASH proved to
be a difficult but satisfying challenge.</p>

<p>It was really fun to make, and I'm eager to find out what other types of
command-line games can be built on top of a pattern like this. Be sure to check out the
Gitwar repo <a href="http://github.com/gitwar/gitwar">here</a>. And give me a shoutout on
<a href="https://twitter.com/share?text=%40tybenz&amp;url=http://tybenz.com/post/gitwar">Twitter</a> if you have comments.</p>
