                <h1><a href="/post/gitwar">Gitwar: Gaming with Git</a></h1>
          </div>
          <div class="post-body">
            <p>I recently came across a <a href="https://github.com/blog/1499-the-revolution-will-be-forked">blog
post</a> that talked about non-developers using Git and GitHub to
do some pretty cool things. It got me thinking about other cool and unsual
things possible with GitHub.</p>

<p>Then I started thinking about games and wondered what it would look like
to have a game with Git at the center. Not something as lame as &quot;who can
create the most branches with the most inappropriate names in the
shortest amount of time?&quot; More like a family of two-player,
head-to-head, text-based, turn-based games with Git as the transfer
protocol.</p>

<p>So I made one, and I did it all in <strong>BASH</strong>.</p>

<p>The games are built using a &quot;platform&quot; called
<a href="http://github.com/gitwar/gitwar">Gitwar</a>. It&#39;s a shared
utility that takes care of adding, committing, pushing, and pulling
to/from the shared repo.</p>

<p>The first game is called
<a href="http://github.com/gitwar/gitwar/tree/master/gitfight">Gitfight</a> and it&#39;s an incredibly simple/corny game where
you tell the game what kind of punch you&#39;d like to throw at your
opponent and basically roll a virtual die to see how much damage you
deal. After you submit your punch, Gitwar takes over and commits that
action to your repo and your opponent can have a chance to punch back.</p>

<p>The second game was an obvious choice. It&#39;s called
<a href="http://github.com/gitwar/gitwar/tree/master/gitchess">Gitchess</a>. This is
where I had the most fun. Creating a more complex game in BASH proved to
be a difficult but satisfying challenge.</p>

<p>It was really fun to make, and I&#39;m eager to find out what other types of
command-line games can be built on top of a pattern like this. Be sure to check out the
Gitwar repo <a href="http://github.com/gitwar/gitwar">here</a>. And give me a shoutout on
<a href="https://twitter.com/share?text=%40tybenz&amp;url=http://tybenz.com/post/gitwar">Twitter</a> if you have comments.</p>

          <div class="post-body">
            <p>Recently I was looking for a designer to collaborate with on a project
called <a href="/post/codearmory">Code Armory</a>. I started looking for online resources to meet some
talented designers. I discovered a site called
<a href="http://collabfinder.com">CollabFinder</a> and immediately realized I had
discovered something of extraordinary value.</p>

<p>CollabFinder allows you to search for designers, developers, artists,
writers, and scientists by physical location, skills, and interests. You
can pitch them a project you&#39;d like to &quot;collaborate&quot; on (collaboration
in this context, means non-monetary help). </p>

<p>So I started looking for designers in the San Francisco area, found some
really talented people, sent them a note about the project I needed help
on, and within an hour I had my replies. I quickly started emailing back
and forth with a designer named <a href="http://twitter.com/lainlee3design">Lain Lee</a>.
He told me he needed some help coding his new design site, and asked if
I&#39;d be interested in trading services. We actually met at Starbucks down
the road from my office that same day, and started talking about our ideas
and life in general. We just clicked. Our interests and passions line up so well.
It&#39;s been a great partnership. Today, I&#39;m happy to say we launched
Lain&#39;s <a href="http://lainlee3design.com">new site</a>.
The site was put together with KirbyCMS, a few jQuery plugins, and
some good ol&#39; fashioned elbow grease.</p>

<p>Quick word about Lain as a designer/illustrator: this guy is one heck of
an artist. Since we&#39;ve started working together I&#39;ve started to follow
his work, and honestly, every thing the guy
creates is pure gold. Check out this
<a href="http://lainlee3design.com/blog/avengers-assemble-timelapse">timelapse</a> of his mad 
illustration skills! The stuff he&#39;s designed for Code Armory is
absolutely perfect. Excellent illustration, web design, and it totally
lines up with my vision for this new project. I&#39;ll be sure to write more
as I move further along with it.</p>

<p>Make sure you head over and check out his new site
(<a href="http://lainlee3design.com">http://lainlee3design.com</a>). Check out his
portfolio and see what you think. I&#39;d highly recommend him for any of your
design needs.</p>

Introducing the coolest way to stay in sync with Basecamp. That's right. It's a node.js script that will send you updates via Mountain Lion's Notification Center whenever something's going down at HQ.

                <h1><a href="/post/bash-url-shortener">Bash URL Shortener</a></h1>
          </div>
          <div class="post-body">
            <p>A couple months ago I got curious about URL shorteners and how they were
implemented. As I was researching the subject, I realized it might be
fun to write my own. So, of course, the next logical step was to steal
someone else&#39;s script and modify it for my needs. (I&#39;ve lost the link to
that actual script I used for my inspiration but it was similar to
<a href="https://gist.github.com/zumbojo/1073996">this</a> one.)</p>

<p>I wanted my URL Shortener to meet a few criteria:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Bash: I wanted to call the script from the command line, have it
register the redirect on the server and put the shortened URL in my
clipboard</p></li>
<li><p>GitHub Pages: I wanted the server with the redirects to be hosted for
free. That naturally brought me to GitHub.</p></li>
<li><p>Awesomeness: I wanted my shortened URLs to live on an awesome domain.
What&#39;s more awesome than the word itself right?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So I registered the domain awes0.me, ported the script over to BASH.
And deployed to Github.</p>

<p>The resulting script keeps a running count of how many URLs have been
generated, generates a hash on that value, creates a directory with that
hash as its name and injects a simple Javascript redirect into an
index.html document inside that directory, and pushes the GitHub Repo.
Deploying a URL that looks something like: <a href="http://awes0.me/K6g">http://awes0.me/K6g</a>.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s it. I can now shorten URLs to my heart&#39;s content. No PHP, no
paid hosting, no headaches. You can view the source <a href="https://gist.github.com/4735033">here</a>.</p>
